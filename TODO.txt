for v0.90:

- change "level" to "room" to avoid confusion with actual, complete stages
- more new icons!
- replace "boss level" part of exit editor w/ new dialog and list

for whenever:

- double click (instead of right-click) to insert sprites/exits?
- generate undo/redo actions when moving sprites/exits
- copying/pasting sprites and exits
- level import/export
- dreamtool level importing
- NES color picker for palette editor
- info about warp star anim., etc. (ask Reimu)
