for whenever:

- generate correct exit location data for tower rooms
  (and maybe be able to select which four rooms those are)
- replace "boss level" part of exit editor w/ new dialog and list
- double click (instead of right-click) to insert sprites/exits?
- generate undo/redo actions when moving sprites/exits
- copying/pasting sprites and exits
- level import/export
- dreamtool level importing
- NES color picker for palette editor
- info about warp star anim., etc. (ask Reimu)
