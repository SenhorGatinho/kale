later:

- change "level" to "room" to avoid confusion with actual, complete stages
- add "boss level" to exit edit window when appropriate exit type selected
- double click (instead of right-click) to insert sprites/exits?
- generate undo/redo actions when moving sprites/exits
- copying/pasting sprites and exits
- level import/export
- dreamtool level importing
- tileset & palette editing
- info about overworld barrier locations
- info about warp star anim., etc. (ask Reimu)
