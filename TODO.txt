- change "level" to "room" to avoid confusion with actual, complete stages
- double click (instead of right-click) to insert sprites/exits?
- generate undo/redo actions when moving sprites/exits
- copying/pasting sprites and exits
- level import/export
- dreamtool level importing
- NES color picker for palette editor
- more new icons!
- make sure most windows actually have fixed size on other platforms
  (i thought i was setting them this way already but apparently wasn't -
   and MSWindowsFixedSizeDialogHint may be pointless)
- replace "boss level" part of exit editor w/ new dialog and list
- info about warp star anim., etc. (ask Reimu)
