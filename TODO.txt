before initial release:

- double click (instead of right-click) to insert sprites/exits?
- don't save too many exits (need to find out max. amount)
- delete sprites/exits
- verify tile/sprite IDs

later:

- limits on sprite/exit counts per level (based on memory allocated for them by the game)
- generate undo/redo actions when moving sprites/exits
- copying/pasting sprites and exits
- level import/export
- dreamtool level importing
- tileset & palette editing
- info about warp star anim., boss level #s, etc. (ask Reimu)
