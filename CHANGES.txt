v0.83 [2014-04-18]
- fixed the limit on # of exits being too high, easily leading to corruption
  (due to some incorrect info on datacrystal)
  this was capable of affecting boss battle info (for the "next world" doors) which
  can now be edited as part of the normal exit data, as well as part of the tileset
  data, which the editor will now repair automatically until the actual tileset editor
  is added (soon, hopefully.)
- added the ability to change boss battle locations when editing a door with type 0x1F
  (the "next" overworld doors)
- fixed a bug where the music track and "no return on death" settings in the level
  properties dialog didn't take effect unless other settings were also changed
  (thanks J^P)
- new "edit exits" and "level properties" menu/window icons (made by Reimu)

v0.82 [2014-03-29]
- fixed double size mode leaving sprites/exits in the wrong place
  (thanks Darkdata)

v0.81 [2014-03-26]
- fixed saved sprite data occasionally being incorrect
- fixed some sprite positions being wrong when a level was more than one screen tall
  (due to the game treating sprite position data as if screens were 16 tiles tall,
   instead of the usual 12)
  (thanks to Reimu for pointing out both of the above)
- destroyable block translucency now affects more types when enabled
  
v0.80 [2014-03-20]
- initial release
