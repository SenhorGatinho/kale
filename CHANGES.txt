v0.81 [2014-03-26]
- fixed saved sprite data occasionally being incorrect
- fixed some sprite positions being wrong when a level was more than one screen tall
  (due to the game treating sprite position data as if screens were 16 tiles tall,
   instead of the usual 12)
  (thanks to Reimu for pointing out both of the above)
- destroyable block translucency now affects more types when enabled
